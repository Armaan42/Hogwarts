# LEARNING OBJECTIVES & OUTCOMES

**Module:** Academic Curriculum  
**Submodule Code:** CURR-OUTCOMES-004  
**Category:** Core Academic  
**Priority:** High (P1)

## Overview

Defines measurable learning objectives and outcomes for each topic, maps to Bloom's taxonomy, and tracks student achievement against defined outcomes.

## Purpose

Establish clear, measurable learning objectives for all topics, define success criteria, and enable outcome-based assessment.

## Key Features

### 4.1 SMART Objectives

**Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound:**
