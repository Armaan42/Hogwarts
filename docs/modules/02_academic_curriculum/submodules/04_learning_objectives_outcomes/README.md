## ⚙️ BUSINESS RULES

### Rule 1: Outcome Achievement Calculation

```javascript
FUNCTION calculate_outcome_achievement(outcome_id, academic_year) {
  // Get total students
  total_students = QUERY("
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT student_id) as count
    FROM outcome_achievement
    WHERE outcome_id = ?
    AND academic_year = ?
  ", [outcome_id, academic_year])
  
  // Get students who achieved outcome
  achieved_students = QUERY("
    SELECT COUNT(*) as count
    FROM outcome_achievement
    WHERE outcome_id = ?
    AND academic_year = ?
    AND achieved = TRUE
  ", [outcome_id, academic_year])
  
  // Calculate achievement percentage
  achievement_percentage = (achieved_students.count / total_students.count) * 100
  
  // Get target
  outcome = GET_OUTCOME(outcome_id)
  target = outcome.target_achievement_percentage
  
  // Compare with target
  gap = achievement_percentage - target
  
  IF gap < -5 {
    // More than 5% below target
    SEND_ALERT("curriculum_team", {
      title: "Learning Outcome Below Target",
      message: `Outcome ${outcome_id}: ${achievement_percentage}% achieved (Target: ${target}%)`,
      gap: gap,
      priority: "MEDIUM"
    })
  }
  
  RETURN {
    total_students: total_students.count,
    achieved_students: achieved_students.count,
    achievement_percentage: achievement_percentage,
    target: target,
    gap: gap,
    status: gap >= 0 ? "MET" : "BELOW_TARGET"
  }
