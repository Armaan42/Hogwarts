## EMI CALCULATOR

### Loan Amount: ₹10 Lakhs

**Bank Comparison:**

| Bank | Interest Rate | Tenure | EMI | Total Interest | Total Repayment |
|------|---------------|--------|-----|----------------|-----------------|
| SBI | 9.0% | 5 years | ₹20,758 | ₹2.45L | ₹12.45L |
| HDFC | 9.5% | 5 years | ₹21,000 | ₹2.60L | ₹12.60L |
| ICICI | 10.0% | 5 years | ₹21,247 | ₹2.75L | ₹12.75L |

**Recommendation:** SBI (lowest interest rate)

---

### EMI Calculation Formula

**EMI = [P × R × (1+R)^N] / [(1+R)^N - 1]**

Where:
- P = Principal (₹10,00,000)
- R = Monthly interest rate (9%/12 = 0.75%)
- N = Number of months (5 years = 60 months)

**Calculation:**
```
EMI = [10,00,000 × 0.0075 × (1.0075)^60] / [(1.0075)^60 - 1]
EMI = [10,00,000 × 0.0075 × 1.5657] / [1.5657 - 1]
EMI = 11,742.75 / 0.5657
EMI = ₹20,758
```
