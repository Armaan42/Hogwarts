## OUTBOUND CONNECTIONS (Analytics → Other Modules)

### 1. TO STUDENT MANAGEMENT MODULE

**WHY This Connection Exists:**
Analytics identifies at-risk students, predicts performance, recommends interventions. Student Management acts on these insights to provide support, counseling, or remedial classes.

**DATA FLOW:**
- **At-Risk Student Alerts:**
  - Student ID, risk score (0-100), risk factors
  - Predicted outcome (dropout risk, failure risk)
  - Recommended interventions
- **Performance Predictions:**
  - Expected final grade, confidence interval
  - Improvement trajectory, decline indicators
- **Intervention Recommendations:**
  - Remedial classes needed, counseling required
  - Peer tutoring matches, study group suggestions
- **Data Volume:** 1,800 students analyzed daily
- **Frequency:** Real-time risk scoring, daily batch predictions
- **Direction:** One-way (Analytics → Student Management)

**TRIGGER EVENT:**
- Daily analytics run (2 AM)
- Real-time alert triggers (attendance drop, grade decline)
- Weekly performance review
- Monthly intervention effectiveness analysis

**IMPACT:**
- **At-Risk Student Identification:**
  - Analytics identifies Rohan (Grade 9) as high-risk
  - Risk score: 75/100 (high dropout risk)
  - Factors: Attendance 68% (↓15%), Math grade 45% (↓20%), Behavior incidents: 3
  - Recommendation: Immediate counseling + remedial Math classes
  - Student Management creates intervention plan
  - Counselor assigned within 24 hours
- **Performance Prediction:**
  - Priya (Grade 10) predicted final score: 88% ±3%
  - Current trajectory: Improving (+5% from mid-term)
  - Recommendation: Maintain current study pattern
  - No intervention needed
- **Success Metrics:**
  - 85% of at-risk students identified early (before failure)
  - 70% intervention success rate (students improve after support)
  - 12% reduction in dropout rate since analytics implementation

**Solution Implemented:**
- Remedial classes for Trigonometry (2 hours/week)
- Peer tutoring (Grade 10 students help Grade 9)
- Visual aids (GeoGebra software for visualization)
- Practice worksheets (100 extra problems)

**Results (December 2024):**
- Trigonometry average: 45% → 72% (+27%)
- Overall Math average: 65% → 78% (+13%)
- Student satisfaction: 3.2/5 → 4.5/5
- Parent complaints: Reduced by 90%

**Lessons Learned:**
- Topic-level analytics crucial (not just overall scores)
- Early intervention prevents long-term issues
- Technology aids (GeoGebra) improve understanding
- Peer tutoring effective and cost-efficient
