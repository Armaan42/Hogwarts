## OUTBOUND CONNECTIONS (Canteen → Other Modules)

### 1. TO STUDENT MANAGEMENT MODULE

**WHY This Connection Exists:**
Canteen needs to track student dietary preferences, allergies, and meal consumption history to provide personalized, safe meal options. Student Management stores this critical health and preference data that directly impacts meal planning and service.

**DATA FLOW:**
- Student dietary preferences (Vegetarian, Vegan, Jain, Non-veg)
- Allergy information (Nuts, Dairy, Gluten, Soy, Eggs)
- Medical dietary restrictions (Diabetic, Celiac, Lactose intolerant)
- Meal consumption history (what student ordered, frequency)
- Canteen wallet balance (current balance, transaction history)
- Spending patterns (daily average, monthly total)
- Favorite items (most ordered dishes)
- Grade and section (for lunch timing coordination)
- Parent contact (for allergy alerts, wallet notifications)

**TRIGGER EVENT:**
- New student enrollment (dietary preferences captured)
- Student updates dietary preference (becomes vegetarian)
- Allergy discovered (parent reports nut allergy)
- Meal purchase (wallet balance updated)
- Wallet recharge (balance increased)
- Medical condition diagnosed (diabetes, requires diet modification)

**IMPACT:**
- **Personalized Meal Recommendations:**
  - Rohan (vegetarian) sees only veg items in app
  - Priya (nut allergy) gets allergy alert when ordering items with nuts
  - Diabetic student Ananya gets low-sugar meal suggestions
- **Safety Alerts:**
  - System blocks nut-containing items for allergic students
  - Warning displayed: "This item contains peanuts. You have a nut allergy."
- **Wallet Management:**
  - Parent gets SMS when balance < ₹100
  - Auto-recharge triggers at ₹50 balance
- **Consumption Analytics:**
  - Student dashboard shows: "You ordered Chole Bhature 8 times this month"
  - Nutritionist can review eating patterns

**BUSINESS LOGIC:**
```
FUNCTION process_meal_order(student_id, item_id):
  student = GET_STUDENT_DATA(student_id)
  item = GET_MENU_ITEM(item_id)
  
  // Check allergies
  IF student.allergies CONTAINS ANY item.allergens:
    SHOW_ALERT("ALLERGY WARNING: This item contains " + item.allergens)
    REQUIRE_CONFIRMATION("Are you sure you want to proceed?")
    IF NOT confirmed:
      RETURN "Order cancelled for safety"
    END IF
  END IF
  
  // Check dietary preference
  IF student.diet_preference == "VEGAN" AND item.contains_dairy:
    SHOW_WARNING("This item contains dairy (not vegan)")
  END IF
  
  // Check wallet balance
  IF student.wallet_balance < item.price:
    RETURN "Insufficient balance. Please recharge wallet."
  END IF
  
  // Process order
  DEDUCT_WALLET_BALANCE(student_id, item.price)
  RECORD_CONSUMPTION(student_id, item_id, timestamp)
  UPDATE_FAVORITE_ITEMS(student_id, item_id)
  
  // Send notifications
  IF student.wallet_balance < 100:
    SEND_SMS(student.parent_mobile, "Wallet balance low: ₹" + balance)
  END IF
  
  RETURN "Order successful"
END FUNCTION
```

  - Revenue predictability: ₹12L/month guaranteed

**BUSINESS LOGIC:**
```
FUNCTION recharge_wallet(student_id, amount, payment_method):
  // Validate amount
  IF amount NOT IN [500, 1000, 2000, 5000]:
    RETURN "Invalid amount. Choose ₹500, ₹1000, ₹2000, or ₹5000"
  END IF
  
  // Process payment
  transaction_id = GENERATE_TRANSACTION_ID()
  payment_status = PROCESS_PAYMENT(amount, payment_method)
  
  IF payment_status == "SUCCESS":
    // Update wallet
    UPDATE_WALLET_BALANCE(student_id, amount, "ADD")
    
    // Record in Fee Management
    RECORD_TRANSACTION({
      type: "CANTEEN_WALLET_RECHARGE",
      student_id: student_id,
      amount: amount,
      transaction_id: transaction_id,
      payment_method: payment_method,
      timestamp: NOW,
      receipt_number: GENERATE_RECEIPT()
    })
    
    // Send notifications

## INBOUND CONNECTIONS (Other Modules → Canteen)

### FROM HEALTH & WELLNESS MODULE

**WHY This Connection Exists:**
Health module tracks student medical conditions, BMI, nutritionist consultations that directly impact meal planning. Canteen must receive this data to provide appropriate, medically-compliant meals.

**DATA RECEIVED:**
- Medical conditions (Diabetes, Obesity, Anemia, Hypertension)
- BMI data (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, Obese)
- Nutritionist diet plans (calorie limits, macro ratios)

- **Portion Control:**
  - Overweight students: Smaller portions automatically served
  - Underweight students: Extra servings encouraged
- **Menu Restrictions:**

**TRIGGER:** Annual health checkup, medical condition diagnosed, nutritionist consultation

**REAL-WORLD EXAMPLE:**
```

```

---

### FROM ATTENDANCE MODULE

**WHY This Connection Exists:**
Attendance data helps canteen predict daily meal requirements, reduce food waste, and optimize procurement. If 200 students are absent, canteen doesn't need to prepare 1,800 meals.

**DATA RECEIVED:**
- Daily attendance count (students present)
- Absentee list (students not in school)
- Half-day information (early dismissals)
- Field trip data (students eating elsewhere)
- Holiday calendar (no meals needed)

**IMPACT:**
- **Accurate Meal Planning:**
  - Normal day: 1,800 students → Prepare 1,800 meals
  - Rainy day: 1,600 students present → Prepare 1,600 meals
  - Field trip day: 180 students on trip → Prepare 1,620 meals
- **Waste Reduction:**
  - Before integration: 200 kg food waste/day
  - After integration: 50 kg food waste/day (75% reduction)
  - Annual savings: ₹5L (reduced waste + procurement)
- **Cost Optimization:**
  - Vegetables ordered based on attendance forecast
  - Milk ordered for actual student count
  - Snacks stocked appropriately

**TRIGGER:** Daily attendance marked (9:00 AM), field trip scheduled, holiday declared

**REAL-WORLD EXAMPLE:**
```
Scenario: Heavy rain day - Low attendance

Date: July 20, 2024 (Monday)
Weather: Heavy rain, flooding in some areas
Normal Attendance: 1,800 students
Actual Attendance: 1,200 students (33% absent)

║  Actual: 1,200 students (67%)                ║
║  Difference: -600 students (33% absent)      ║
║                                              ║
║  RECOMMENDATION:                             ║
║  - Reduce lunch preparation by 33%           ║
║  - Prepare 1,200 meals instead of 1,800      ║
║  - Save excess vegetables for tomorrow       ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════╝

Canteen Manager Action:
- Adjusts cooking quantities
- Rice: 60 kg → 40 kg
- Dal: 30 kg → 20 kg
- Vegetables: 40 kg → 27 kg
- Roti: 3,600 pieces → 2,400 pieces

Result:

- Leftover: 70 meals (distributed to staff, security guards)
- Food waste: 5 kg (minimal)
- Cost saved: ₹8,000 (vegetables, ingredients)

Without Attendance Integration:
